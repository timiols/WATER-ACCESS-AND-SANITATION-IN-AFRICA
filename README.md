# Water Access And Sanitation In Africa
### Project Overview
This project analyzes water access and sanitation across various communities in multiple African countries. By examining key patterns and trends within the dataset, the analysis aims to uncover disparities, identify critical areas for improvement, and provide data-driven recommendations. The insights generated will help governments, policymakers, and stakeholders implement effective strategies to enhance water accessibility and sanitation infrastructure in these communities.

### Data Source
Axia Africa : The primary data used for this analysis is the "Water_access_and_sanitation_in_africa.csv" containing details about water availability and sanitation in several communities in selected african countires.

### Tools
- Power query
- SQL

### Data Cleaning
The dataset used in this analysis was provided in a clean and consistent format. An initial assessment was conducted to check for missing values, duplicate entries, and data type inconsistencies. No data cleaning or preprocessing steps were required. The data was determined to be ready for immediate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
What is the average water availability (litres per capita per day) for each country?
